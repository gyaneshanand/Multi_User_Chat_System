# Multi_User_Chat_System

Design and implementation of a multiuser chat system that is like a real-time instant message board system, much like
IRC. The users should be able to talk to one another and to everyone else. The system needs to make sure which message is meant for whom â€“ for individual user or for everyone. The message meant for everyone should be flashed on the
system for everyone to view. The messages meant for individual users need to  be handled by the individual users themselves.
Popular Linux IPC mechanism have been used for the same.

For now, please ignore synchronization/race-condition prevention.
